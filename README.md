# AVR_SCLib
There is a manual called manual.tex in Chinese.

##### This lib depends on avr-gcc 4.6 and ATmega328P

Common library of AVR ATmega328
-----

The SClib is only tested for ATmega16, it cannot support the others.

Thanks

The Files, LCD.c and LCD.h, are based on a book, "QingSong WanZhuan AVR Danpanji". I just write a macro to let it easy when chenge the PIN used to drive LCD 1602. \
The Files, USART.c and I2C.c, are based on the Datasheet of ATmega16.
